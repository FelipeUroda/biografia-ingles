    <h1>Biography of Gabriel Quitério dos Santos</h1>
    <img src="./img/Quiterio.jpg" alt="Gabriel Quitério dos Santos">
    <p>Gabriel Quitério dos Santos, known as Quitério, was born on November 1, 2008, son of Raimunda Maria Pereira Quitério and Leorlandio Martins dos Santos. Since childhood, he dreamed of becoming a professional soccer player. In 2017, he started training at the GOL DE LETRA soccer school in São Raimundo das Mangabeiras, where he quickly stood out. He became team captain and began traveling for matches.</p>

    <p>In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted everything. That same year, a tragic event changed his life: his uncle was involved in a shootout with a gang, forcing Gabriel and his family to move to São Félix de Balsas for safety reasons.</p>

    <p>In the new city, they faced difficulties but found shelter with his great-grandmother. Gabriel continued playing soccer and stood out once again. In 2022, he fractured his arm during training and fell into depression. Even so, he decided to keep fighting for his family.</p>

    <p>Back in his hometown at the end of 2022, he joined the Gradual Social FC (PSG) project. In 2024, he gave up football due to financial reasons and focused on his studies, enrolling at IFMA. There, he discovered athletics and began competing in races. In 2025, he won the 100m dash and the 4x100m relay at JEMAN, earning two gold medals.</p>

    <p>Today, Quitério continues his journey, determined to become someone great and recognized in the future.</p>
