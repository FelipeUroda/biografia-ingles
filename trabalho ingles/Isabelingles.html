  <h2>His Story</h2>
  <p>João was born in the city of Grajaú and had a very good childhood.</p> <p> He studied at Major Altino school and enjoyed participating in local church festivals. He didn’t grow up in a rich family, but he was happy and learned to value life.</p>

  <p>He became a farmer and worked hard every day. One of his dreams was to get his driver's license. </p> <p> It wasn’t easy, because he had to travel every day from Formosa da Serra Negra to Grajaú, where the driving school was. But he didn’t give up and finally got it.</p>

  <p>He bought some land and built a family. His biggest inspirations were his mother and father.</p> <p> João didn’t waste time — every morning, he woke up early, thanked God, and worked hard to build a better future.</p>

  <p>He didn’t want to live in big cities, but he visited nearby towns and even traveled to Tocantins.</p> <p> For him, family, friends, and religion were the most important things in life.</p>

  <h2>Beliefs and Legacy</h2>
  <p>He believed in loving God, protecting his family, and helping others.</p> <p> He wished the retirement system for elders had started earlier in Brazil. One of the most special days in his life was his wedding.</p>
