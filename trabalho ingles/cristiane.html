    <h1>Fernanda da Cruz Ferreira</h1>
    <img src="./img/Foto Cristiane.jpg">
    <p>Fernanda da Cruz Ferreira was born on October 3, 1990, and her life story deserves to be told with pride.</p>
    <p>Since she was a child, her life has been marked by many struggles. She grew up in the countryside, doing heavy work, cracking coconuts, helping in the fields, and still finding the strength to study. Things were really hard... every day she had to fetch water from the stream with a bucket on her head. And that wasn't all, she also had to do the housework, even though she was just a girl.</p>
    <p>She went through a lot of suffering, through moments that many people wouldn't be able to bear. But she never stopped believing. Fernanda always had great faith in God and an impressive strength. Even with so many difficulties, she kept going, firm, determined and grateful to be alive.</p>
    <p>Today, when I look at her, I see a strong woman, who carries in her heart every battle she won and in her eyes the hope of better days. Her story inspires me and teaches me that, no matter how hard the journey is, with faith and courage we always get there.</p>
