		Biography: Danilo Vieira Rodrigues

Danilo Vieira was born in 2011, in a small town called Pastos Bons, but he grew up in São Raimundo das Mangueiras. He has always liked quiet places and simple things. He enjoyed riding his bike, listening to music, and playing soccer.

At school, Danilo was an average student. He wasn’t the best in the class, but he wasn’t the worst either. He did his homework, paid attention in class, and tried his best — even when things were difficult.

Danilo never liked math very much, but he was good at history and geography. He didn’t like speaking in front of the class, but he loved writing.

In 2025, he took part in JEMAN. Although his team didn’t win the championship, they stood out by winning three games and finishing as runners-up. Danilo scored a goal in each game, and his coach was very pleased with his performance and plans to call him up for future matches.

Today, Danilo is 14 years old. He now lives in São Raimundo das Mangueiras with his parents and his brother. He continues to study, play soccer, and enjoy the simple things in life. Danilo may not be famous, but he is kind, curious, and always trying to improve.
