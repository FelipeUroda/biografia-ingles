    <h1>Nome: Hellen Cristiny Brito</h1>
    <p>Raimunda Dias was born on February 16, 1968, in São Raimundo das Mangabeiras, Brazil. She lived a life marked by strength, love, and dedication to her family. A devoted mother, Raimunda raised three children—one daughter and two sons—whom she loved deeply and supported unconditionally.</p>
    <p>Later in life, she became a grandmother to three grandchildren—again, one girl and two boys. Raimunda played a central role in their upbringing, caring for them with endless affection and devotion. To them, she was more than a grandmother; she was like a second mother, offering warmth, guidance, and unconditional love.</p>
    <p>Raimunda faced many challenges in life with courage and resilience. Sadly, she passed away on her 55th birthday, February 16, 2023, after a battle with bone cancer. Her memory lives on in the hearts of her children and grandchildren, who carry forward her legacy of love, compassion, and strength.</p>
