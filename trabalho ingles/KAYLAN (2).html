        <p><strong>Kauany Cavalcante Sá Barros</strong> was born on <strong>May 11, 2004</strong>, in <strong>São Raimundo das Mangabeiras, Maranhão, Brazil</strong>. Today, at <strong>21 years old</strong>, I can only say how much I admire her strength and dedication.</p>

        <p>Since she was little, she was raised by our <strong>grandmother</strong> while our mother had to move to Manaus. Even with the distance, she always kept our family close, and the love between us has always remained strong, even though we lived apart.</p>

        <p>Kauany studied in <strong>public schools</strong> and faced every challenge with courage and the will to grow. As a child, she was <strong>sweet, calm, and observant</strong> — and those traits have only grown stronger. Today, she is <strong>kind, detailed, and very hardworking</strong>.</p>

        <p>She found her passion in the <strong>beauty and skincare field</strong>, and it’s amazing to see her almost graduating from college and already working in what she loves. She balances <strong>work and study</strong> with incredible dedication and organization.</p>

        <p>In her free time, she enjoys peaceful moments to rest and recharge. Her loving nature, her attention to detail, and her willpower inspire me deeply. She achieves everything she sets her mind to because she never gives up.</p>

        <p>To me, she’s more than a sister — she’s a <strong>role model</strong>. Her story is a beautiful example of <strong>perseverance, love, and strength</strong>, and I’m sure her future will be full of great accomplishments. I'm very <strong>proud</strong> of you, Kauany.</p>
