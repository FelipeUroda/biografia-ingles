	<p>

	Ana Rita was born in Balsas on April 24, 2004, and grew up in the village of Morro do Chupé. She studied at IFMA during high school, but due to the pandemic, she did most of her studies online. She studied Entrepreneurship, although, honestly, it wasn't something she loved.</p>

<p>
	She is a calm person, who even tries to persist in things, but is often the first to give up when she loses interest — and she accepts this in a good way. What really makes her eyes shine is art. She loves to paint, create paintings and get lost in the universe of colors and shapes. Music is also one of her greatest passions, as is her love for cats, which she simply can't resist. And, when she's not painting or listening to music, she likes to spend her time watching series.

<p>
	Ana Rita is like this: she doesn't force what she doesn't like, but truly gives herself over to what makes her heart feel at home — like art, music, cats and her favorite series.
