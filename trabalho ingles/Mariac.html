        <p>Nilo Peçanha Dias Carneiro Neto was born on January 4, 1983, in the city of São João dos Patos, in the state of Maranhão, Brazil. During his childhood, he moved to Loreto, also in Maranhão, where he spent most of his youth.</p>

        <p>In 1985, he enrolled in the Pato Donald Kindergarten, starting his educational journey. At the age of 15, he left Loreto and moved to Teresina, in the state of Piauí, with the goal of attending high school. During this period, he stood out in sports, winning first place in swimming and second place in futsal at the School Games when he was in the second year of high school.</p>

        <p>At the age of 21, he moved to São Luís, the capital of Maranhão, to take a preparatory course. The following year, he went to live in Imperatriz, also in Maranhão, where he enrolled in the Zootechnics program, continuing his studies.</p>

        <p>At 24, after a difficult family situation caused by a betrayal, he moved to Boa Vista, in the state of Roraima, to live with his father. At 25, he began working at the TV Ativa television station. After resigning from the station, he worked in construction as a painter and later at the Bertollini Transport Company. He left that job to care for his sick father.</p>

        <p>He then worked at Advanced Graphics. During this period, he got engaged and later married Ingrid Vieira de Mattos. He then decided to resign and, together with his wife, started a food business selling cakes and savory snacks.</p>

        <p>At the age of 26, Nilo had his first daughter and bought his first car. When he was 28, he returned to Loreto, where his second daughter was born. In the city, he began working at the Loreto Hospital.</p>

        <p>At 29, he ran for city councilor. However, that same year, he suffered a serious car accident that resulted in the fracture of three ribs. After this incident, he resigned from the hospital, bought a farm, and dedicated himself to agriculture.</p>

        <p>In 2015, he had his third child. In 2020, he ran for mayor of Loreto but was unsuccessful in the election. The following year, in 2021, he had an accident while trying to build a house for sheep, fracturing his hand.</p>

        <p>In May 2023, he faced another life-threatening situation, nearly dying after being attacked by a cow.</p>
