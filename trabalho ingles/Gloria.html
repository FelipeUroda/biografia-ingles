  <p>A hard-working and much-loved young woman, her full name is Clara Cristinny Barros. She was born on August 2, 2008, in the city of São Raimundo das Mangabeiras, in the south of Maranhão, a state in Brazil. Her mother's name is Ociene Barros and her father's name is Manoel Pereira. She grew up with her three siblings: her older sister, Emanuelle, and her two younger brothers, Gabriel and Raquel. Clara also has another brother on her father's side, but she never had the opportunity to meet him.</p>

  <p>Clara's childhood was happy and fun. In her own words, she said: "I loved waking up early to watch cartoons on TV." She also played with her neighbors on the street and helped her mother around the house whenever she could. She studied at two schools during her childhood: she attended elementary school at Escola Jardim de Infância Chapéuzinho Vermelho and elementary school at Escola Unidade Integrada Dom João Bosco. Clara was always an exemplary and hard-working student — a true example and inspiration. She always liked history and showed it in her school tests. In addition to her studies, she excelled — and still excels — in dancing.</p>

  <p>For a while, Clara worked as a nanny for a child, but because of her studies, she had to quit her job, even though she really liked it. She still doesn't work today.</p>

  <p>An important moment in her life was when she was preparing for the IFMA selection test. Clara reported that she suffered from nervousness and pressure, but she managed to pass and was very happy with the result.</p>

  <p>Clara's life has many stories. One of them happened during a trip with her family: she and her cousins were playing with some objects and ended up causing the van they were traveling in to stop in the middle of the road. Fortunately, everything ended well after help arrived.</p>

  <p>Well, this is just the beginning of Clara Cristinny's extraordinary life. Today, she still lives in São Raimundo das Mangabeiras, studies at IFMA and is in the 2nd year of high school, along with the IT technical course. She greatly values her mother, who is an example of strength, and also her boyfriend. To everyone, she leaves the following advice: "Study."</p>

  <p>This is only about Clara's first 16 years, but in the future much more can — and will — be written about this young woman who carries charisma, joy and a lot of light.</p>
