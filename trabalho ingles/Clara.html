        <p>Glória Maria Alves Lima was born on December 14, 2008, in São Raimundo das Mangabeiras, Maranhão. She is the daughter of Raimunda Maria Alves and Fredson Rodrigues Lima. Her childhood was very fun, filled with playing in the street with friends and cousins who lived near her house.</p>

        <p>During her childhood, she studied at a daycare (unnamed), then at Chapéuzinho Vermelho Kindergarten, and completed elementary school at Unidade Integrada Ceci Teixeira e Silva and Dom João Bosco schools. She is currently attending high school at the Federal Institute of Maranhão, excelling in Math and Portuguese, her favorite subjects.</p>

        <p>Glória has always been dedicated to her studies and household chores. In her free time, she enjoys reading, dancing, singing, and drawing. One of the most memorable moments of her life was meeting her best friend, Clara, with whom she formed a strong bond after sharing an apple at school.</p>

        <p>For Glória, the most important thing in life is staying close to God and maintaining unity and love among her family and friends. She advises people to enjoy their childhood and value those who will always be by their side. If she could change anything, she wouldn’t change a thing, as she believes everything she has experienced made her who she is today.</p>
