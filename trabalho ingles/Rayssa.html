		<h1><p>Roberto da Silva Brito was born on July 13, 1989, at the São Raimundo Nonato Hospital, located in the municipality of São Raimundo das Mangabeiras, in Maranhão. Although he was born in the city, he spent his childhood in the countryside known as Brejão dos Britos, 27 km from the city center.</font></i></b></p></h1>

<b><i><font size="5" color="black"><h2><p>Roberto grew up in a humble and large family, consisting of his parents, Silvino de Oliveira Brito and Maria Edice da Silva, and five siblings – four boys and one girl, who was the youngest. His father, a strict and determined man, and his mother, dedicated and hard-working, worked hard to provide better conditions for their children. Over time, they managed to build a house in the city, seeking to facilitate access to education.</font></i></b></p></h2>

<b><i><font size="5" color="black"><h3><p>Without their own transportation, only Roberto's siblings walked to the city during the week to study, returning to the countryside on the weekends. They attended the Maria Gomes School, carrying their school supplies in plastic bags and storing their clothes in cardboard boxes, as they could not afford backpacks or wardrobes.</font></i></b></p></h3>

<b><i><font size="5" color="black"><h4><p>Despite being a very intelligent young man, Roberto did not finish high school. During this time, he fell in love with Edilza Maria dos Anjos, born on July 14, 1988, a student at the same school and a resident of a more remote village. Despite the difficulties, the relationship prospered, and the two are still together today.</font></i></b></p></h4>

<b><i><font size="5" color="black"><h5><p>When they heard about their first pregnancy, Roberto and Edilza went to live in the countryside with his parents and started working selling buriti oil. The bicycle they had obtained became their main means of transportation between the countryside and the city. During this period, the couple's first daughter, Rayssa dos Anjos Brito, was born on February 6, 2009, in the village where Edilza's family lived, where she worked as a teacher.</font></i></b></p></h5>

<b><i><font size="5" color="black"><h6><p>After a while, the family moved to Roberto's parents' house in the city. Three years later, their second son, Thiago dos Anjos Brito, was born on April 5, 2012.</font></i></b></p></h6>

<b><i><font size="5" color="black"><h7><p>Roberto started working as a delivery man for a gas distributor. He worked there for many years, until, as the business expanded, he was promoted to cashier. For a few years during this period, he also raised chickens in the countryside owned by his father. Every night, after work, he would go there, slaughter 10 to 15 birds and bring them to sell.</font></i></b></p></h7>

<b><i><font size="5" color="black"><h8><p>This was yet another of the many ways in which Roberto demonstrated his commitment to the family's livelihood and well-being.</font></i></b></p></h8>

<b><i><font size="5" color="black"><h9><p>With a lot of effort and dedication, in 2017, Roberto achieved one of his biggest dreams: he built his own house. And later, he took an even bigger step by opening his own business: a butcher shop, where he still works with great pride today.</font></i></b></p></h9>

<b><i><font size="5" color="black"><h10><p>"Courage is not about not being afraid. It's about continuing even when you're afraid."</font></i></b></p></h10>

<b><i><font size="5" color="black"><h11><p>This phrase sums up Roberto's essence – a warrior who turned obstacles into achievements and who carries in his heart the pride of everything he built with effort, love and perseverance.</font></i></b></p></h11>
