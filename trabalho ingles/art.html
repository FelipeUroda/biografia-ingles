        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Rhuan Gabriel da Silva Sousa was born on <strong>May 25, 2012</strong>, in <strong>São Raimundo das Mangabeiras</strong>, a small town in the state of Maranhão, Brazil. His mother was also born there, and she raised him with love and care. His father, originally from the state of Tocantins, was present in Rhuan’s early life, but later separated from his mother. Rhuan’s family didn’t have much money, but he was raised with strong values, respect, and a love for simple things — especially football.</p></hr>

        <h2>Health Challenge in 2022</h2>
        <p>In 2022, when Rhuan was 10 years old, he got COVID-19. Fortunately, the symptoms were mild and he didn’t suffer any serious effects. He stayed home, rested, and recovered quickly. Even during those quiet days, he dreamed of returning to the field and playing football with his friends.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Beginning His Football Journey</h2>
        <p>Rhuan always loved football, but it was only at the age of <strong>11</strong> that he started training seriously. That’s when he met his coach, <strong>Guia</strong>, a strong and supportive woman who believed in his potential. Under her guidance, Rhuan learned how to play with discipline and confidence.</p>
        <p>He trained hard and quickly stood out for his energy and determination. He didn’t mind the heat, the rain, or even long days—he just wanted to play. He took on two very different positions: <strong>goalkeeper</strong> and <strong>forward</strong>. That made him unique on his team. In goal, he made strong saves; up front, he wasn’t afraid to attack and score.</p>

        <h2>Passion for Flamengo</h2>
        <p>Rhuan is a proud fan of <strong>Flamengo</strong>. He watches every match he can and cheers for the team with passion. He dreams of one day wearing the red and black jersey, stepping onto a big field, and representing the team he loves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Turning 13</h2>
        <p>Today, Rhuan is <strong>13 years old</strong>. He celebrated his birthday on <strong>May 25, 2025</strong>, surrounded by family, friends, and football—just the way he loves it. He continues to train with Coach Guia and works every day to improve his skills.</p>
        <p>Rhuan knows that the road to becoming a professional football player is not easy, especially without money or connections. But he also knows that dedication, effort, and love for the game can take him far. His story is just beginning, but it already shows strength, resilience, and heart.</p>
