    <h1>Kaiane Santos Costa</h1>
    <p>Kaiane Santos Costa was born on November 17, 2008, and is currently a student, experiencing a phase of discovery, learning, and the building of dreams. From a very young age, she has shown a communicative, sensitive, and thoughtful personality. She enjoys being surrounded by friends, talking about a variety of topics, and especially listening to and advising those who come to her. Her kindness, attentiveness, and empathy make her a trustworthy and supportive presence in the lives of those who know her.</p>

    <p>This natural connection with dialogue and care for others led Kaiane to develop an interest in pursuing a career in Psychology. Her biggest dream is to one day help people understand their emotions, face their challenges, and find lighter, healthier paths in life. However, Kaiane also believes that God's plans are above all, and if Psychology is not part of her journey, she is open to exploring another field of study and following new paths with courage and faith.</p>

    <p>Determination, a love of learning, and a desire for personal growth are strong marks in her story. Kaiane continues her journey with confidence, believing in the value of human connection and in the power of listening as a transformative force in people's lives.</p>
